# Harrison's Climbing App

This web application is a dashboard takes [data](https://github.com/harrisonized/climbing-app-heroku/tree/master/static/data) from a CSV file hosted the server and creates data visualizations.

Everything takes place on the server side. Each plot is generated by executing a SQL query and feeding the result into plotly. Please check out the live website [here](https://harrisonized-climbing-app.herokuapp.com/), the underlying logic [here](https://github.com/harrisonized/climbing-app/tree/master/v2), and feel free to [email me](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) if you'd like to connect about climbing or collaborate on building dashboards or climbing apps.
